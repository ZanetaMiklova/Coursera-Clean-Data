variables in data.frame data2

"subject"			integer: represent the number of subject

"activity"			character: provided activity


As a subset of mean measurements I chose this integer variable:

"tBodyAcc.mean...X"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tBodyAcc.mean...Y"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tBodyAcc.mean...Z"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tGravityAcc.mean...X"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tGravityAcc.mean...Y"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tGravityAcc.mean...Z"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tBodyGyro.mean...X"		integer: average of mean from original dataset	

"tBodyGyro.mean...Y"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"tBodyGyro.mean...Z"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"fBodyAcc.mean...X"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"fBodyAcc.mean...Y"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"fBodyAcc.mean...Z"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"fBodyGyro.mean...X"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"fBodyGyro.mean...Y"		integer: average of mean from original dataset

"fBodyGyro.mean...Z"		integer: average of mean from original dataset



As a subset of std measurements I chose this integer variable:

"tBodyAcc.std...X"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tBodyAcc.std...Y"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tBodyAcc.std...Z"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tGravityAcc.std...X"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tGravityAcc.std...Y"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tGravityAcc.std...Z"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tBodyGyro.std...X"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tBodyGyro.std...Y"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"tBodyGyro.std...Z"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"fBodyAcc.std...X"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"fBodyAcc.std...Y"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"fBodyAcc.std...Z"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"fBodyGyro.std...X"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"fBodyGyro.std...Y"		integer: average of std from original dataset

"fBodyGyro.std...Z"		integer: average of std from original dataset
